# diii
Dependency injection library based on injections refs. 
Works in runtime. 

## Motivation
Two things:
- working in pure js (no TS, Flow)
- not string based work for better refactoring

## Install
``` sh
npm install dill --save
```

## Usage

Guides are coming soon. At this time just see [tests](https://github.com/DmitryMakhnev/diii/blob/master/src/diii.test.js)
